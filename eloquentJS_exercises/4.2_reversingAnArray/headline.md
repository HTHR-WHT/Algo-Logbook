## Eloquent JavaScript - 4.2 Reversing an Array

**Prompt:**
Arrays have a `reverse` method that changes the array by inverting the order in which its
elements appear. For this exercise, write two functions, `reverseArray` and `reverseArrayInPlace`.
The first, `reverseArray`, takes an array as argument and produces a *new* array that has the same
elements in the inverse order. The second, `reverseArrayInPlace`, does what the `reverse`
method does: it *modifies* the array given as argument by reversing its elements. Neither
may use the standard `reverse` method.

> Example 1:
> 
> Input: `reverseArray(["A", "B", "C"])`
>  
> Output: `["C", "B", "A"]`
>
> Input: `let arrayValue = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`
>        `reverseArrayInPlace(arrayValue)`
>  
> Output: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
