## Eloquent JavaScript - 3.2 Recursion

**Prompt:**
- Zero is even.
- One is odd.
- For any other number `N`, its evenness is the same as `N - 2`.

Define a recursive function `isEven` corresponding to this description.  The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean.  Test it on 50 and 75.  See how it behaves on -1.  Why?  Can you think of a way to fix this?

> Example 1:
> 
> Input: `50`
>  
> Output: `true`
>
> Input: `75`
>  
> Output: `false`
>
> Input: `-1`
>
> Output: `???`
