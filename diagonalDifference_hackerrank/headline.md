## Hacker Rank (1 wk prep kit) - Diagonal Difference

**Prompt:**

Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.

For example, the square matrix `arr` is shown below:
`1 2 3`
`4 5 6`
`9 8 9`

The left-to-right diagonal = `1 + 5 + 9 = 15` . The right to left diagonal = `3 + 5 + 9 = 17`. Their absolute difference is `15 - 17 = 2`.

> Example 1:
> 
> Input: 
> `3`
> `11 2 4`
> `4 5 6`
> `10 8 -12`
>  
> Output: `15`

>> Notes: 
>>The first line contains a single integer, `n`, the number of rows and columns in the square matrix `arr`.
>>Each of the next `n` lines describes a row, `arr[i]`, and consists of `n` space-separated integers `arr[i][j]`.
>>
>> Input : int `arr[n][m]`: an array of integers
>>
>> Returns: int: the absolute diagonal difference
