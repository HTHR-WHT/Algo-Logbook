# #100DaysOfCode Challenge

## Hacker Rank (1 wk prep kit) - Plus Minus

**Prompt:**

Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with  places after the decimal.

Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to 10^-4 are acceptable.

> Example 1:
> 
> Input: arr [1,1,0,-1,-1] 
>  
> Output: Results are printed as:
> 0.400000
> 0.400000
> 0.200000  
>
>> Explanations: 
>> There are n=5 elements, two positive, two negative and one zero. Their ratios are 2/5 = 0.400000, 2/5 = 0.400000, and 1/5 = 0.200000.
